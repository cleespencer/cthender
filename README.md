This project started off as a recreation of the classic Williams videogame "Defender".
Over the course of development it grew into its own game while still bearing some
inherited traits from its grandparent.

With Firefox 29 and recent Chrome versions it has become possible to code rather
complex games running at 60FPS.  This is my first effort at programming a game in
JavaScript.

One of the real problems I had when doing this project was the almost complete
absence of non-toy HTML5 games with released source code.  I found myself
translating gaming concepts from other languages to JavaScript with no real
road map.  I wanted the next person to not have such difficulties.

If you open up my source code and gasp in horror at what you find within, you
have my apologies.  Not only was this my first game in JavaScript, it was my
first real application in JavaScript (I'm a Python/C/C++ expatriate).There
are geological layers of self-education in the code.  I will eventually do
a massive tidy-up, but for now you can wait or be horrified.
